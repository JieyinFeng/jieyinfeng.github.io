The off-key choir,\
the smiley clown,\
the runny cake,\
and the pushy crowd

The trending train,\
the rattling windows,\
the squeaking shoes,\
and the screaming kid.

The painful pinch,\
the dreadful cry,\
the doubtful glance,\
the awful laugh.

The deadly legs,\
the foggy brain,\
the beating heart,\
the disordered mind,


##### Background of the poem:
I had a rough day today at work in the school. Some kids were disrespectful. Some colleagues were very pushy. The system in school was disordered.、
I experienced an awkward frustration
