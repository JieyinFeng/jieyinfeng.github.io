    - Life in Spain
    - my poems
---

the lazy bone and the crunchy toast\
the fresh brew and the lousy chain\
the chirping birds and the tangled mind\
the chatty crowds and the smiley lone

the blue sky and the white contrail\
the shining waves and the floating wood\
the fresh breeze and the burning coal\
the quiet street and the swamped soul

the comfy bed and the empty bed\
the heavy blanket and the fluffy sloth\
the cozy night and the flinched nose\
the sinking body and the stumped wit

Mornings, rejuvenated with the air\
Afternoons, ghosted with the time\
Evenings, buzzed with the thoughts\
Now, cheered with the peace

##### Background of the poem:
I teach English in a public high school and live in Rota, Cadiz, Spain. It is a small town on the North Pacific coast. This poem is to describe my anxious springtime in 2025 while waiting for the result of my job application. The reason for “the ghosted afternoon” is that it is siesta time in Spain and its quietness makes me miss my boyfriend a lot.
