### 1. Read the following text and answer the following questions.
(1) The crisis didn’t affect agriculture. (   )\
(2) The prices of shares were the same as their real value. (  )\
(3) During the recession, unemployment increased. (   )\
(4) People didn’t know if they should withdraw their money from the bank. (   )\
(5) People wanted to sell their shares. (   )

During the Roaring Twenties, the stock market was booming. Profits led to a rise in demand for shares, whose value rose steadily. 
The economy could not continue to grow at such a rapid rate forever. Many people knew that the prices of shares were higher than their real value. On 24th of October 1929, people began to panic and sell massive amounts of stock. Everyone wanted to sell their shares and no one wanted to buy them. This caused a sharp fall in share prices, which resulted in the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Many investors lost everything. Panic spread and people flocked to the banks to withdraw their money. Banks lost the money they had loaned to people and companies that had gone bankrupt. Banks had no money to lend to customers so there was a credit crunch. Many banks had to close. The crisis affected industry, trade and agriculture and caused a widespread economic recession (the Great Depression). Unemployment increased, consumption declined and many factories closed. Many families fell into poverty.
