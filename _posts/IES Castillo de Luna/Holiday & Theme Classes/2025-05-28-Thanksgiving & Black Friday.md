### GAME 1. WORD SEARCH FOR THANKSGIVING WORDS

### GAME 2. BLACK FRIDAY
#### Read. What does the term Black Friday mean?
In the past, rich workers wrote the profits and losses of their business in special books. They used red ink to record losses. They used black ink to record profits. To be “in the red” meant losing a lot of money. And to be “in the black” meant making a profit. So Black Friday was the special day when shops started to be in the black ink.

#### Listen to the text and find one extra word in each line.
