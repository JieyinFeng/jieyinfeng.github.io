#### THE SOCIAL MEDIA STALKER SONG (Every breath you take, THE POLICE)

Every ____________ you make, Every ___________ you take\
Every __________ you make , Every heart you break\
I'll be stalking you. I see _________ every day, Hear the words you say\
Play the __________ you play ,  Every night and day\
I'll be stalking you.

Oh you're not _________ , There's no privacy\
And all it takes are the rules __________ break.\
The random ___________ you make , Party pix you take\
The words are not opaque, Each mistake you ____________\
I'll be stalking you.

When you're gone - I'm still there - you leave _________ trace\
Your GPS is ____________ and you don't erase\
All day, all night, I can always - see your _____________\
Your ___________ private settings are a disgrace\
I'm still stalking you … daily… it's easy

Oh you should be, So creeped out by ____________\
Your privacy's gone so totally\
The ______________ pic you made, Your checking-in tirade\
Details displayed Say you're __________ afraid\
But I'm stalking you.

Random friends ____________ made , Fell for my charade\
I'll be stalking you
