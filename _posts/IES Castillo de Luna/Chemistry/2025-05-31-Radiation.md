####  Watch the video and answer the following questions.
1. What are the two types of radiation? ________________________ and  _________________________.

2. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy, consisting of _______ electrical and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves _______ faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the _______, there's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays.

3. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other
due to their  _______  positive charges. A  _______  known as the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus  _______ . However, some combinations of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain  _______ , or radioactive. They will  _______  eject matter and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater  _______ . 

4. Is all radiation hazardous?  _______

5. Are all nuclear radiation ionizing?  _______

6. Are all electromagnetic radiation ionizing?  _______

7. What is ionizing radiation?.

8. Give two examples: how do we escape the risk of hazardous radiation?

9. Give two examples: the application of radiation in our daily life.

10. Acute exposure. \
What is acute exposure?\
What are the consequences of the acute exposure?

11. One way scientists compare ionizing radiation exposure is a unit called the _______. An acute exposure to one sievert will probably cause _______ within hours, and four sieverts could be _______.

#### ANSWER SHEET
1. Electromagnetic radiation, nuclear radiation\
2. Interacting, oscillate, spectrum\
3. mutually, phenomenon, intact, unstable, randomly, stability. \
4. no\
5. yes\
6. no\
7. Radiation becomes risky when it rips atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost or gained electrons is called an ion.\
8. \
9.\
10. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's natural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death.\
11. Sievert, nausea, fatal.
