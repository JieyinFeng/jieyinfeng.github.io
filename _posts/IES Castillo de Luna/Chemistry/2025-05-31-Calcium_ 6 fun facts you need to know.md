### Calcium_ 6 fun facts you need to know
#### Fun Fact 1. Calcium plays a role in your body’s functions
Calcium plays a role in many of your body’s basic functions. Your body needs calcium in order to circulate blood, move muscles, and release hormones. Calcium also helps carry messages from your brain to other parts of your body. Calcium is a major part of tooth and bone health as well. It makes your bones strong and dense. You can think of your bones as your body’s calcium reservoir. If you don’t get enough calcium in your diet, your body will take it from your bones.

#### Fun Fact 2. Your body doesn’t produce calcium
Your body doesn’t produce calcium, so you have to rely on your diet to get the calcium you need. Foods that are high in calcium include:
dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt\
dark green vegetables such as a kale, spinach, and broccoli\
white beans\
sardines\
calcium-fortified breads, cereals, soy products, and orange juices

#### Fun Fact 3. You need vitamin D to absorb calcium
Your body needs vitamin D in order to absorb calcium. That means you won’t fully benefit from a calcium-rich diet if you’re low on vitamin D. You can get vitamin D from certain foods, such as salmon, egg yolks, and some mushrooms. Like calcium, some food products have vitamin D added to them. For example, milk often has added vitamin D. Sunshine is your best source of vitamin D. Your skin naturally produces vitamin D when exposed to the sun. Those with darker skin don’t produce vitamin D as well, so supplements may be necessary to avoid deficiency.

#### Fun Fact 4. Calcium is even more important for women
Several studies show that calcium may ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This studyTrusted Source concluded that women with PMS have lower intakes of calcium and magnesium, and lower serum levels.

#### Fun Fact 5. The recommended amount depends on your age
How do you know if you’re getting enough calcium? The National Institutes of Health (NIH)Trusted Source say that adults should get 1,000 mg every day. For women over 50 and during pregnancy and breast-feeding, NIH recommends 1,200 mg daily. One cup of skim, low-fat, or whole milk contains about 300 mg of calcium. 

#### Fun Fact 6. Too much calcium can have negative effects
With any mineral or nutrient, it’s important to get the right amount. Too much calcium can have negative side effects. Symptoms such as constipation, gas, and bloating may indicate that you’re getting too much calcium. Extra calcium may also increase your risk of kidney stones. In rare cases, too much calcium can cause deposits of calcium in your blood. This is called hypercalcemia.
