#### 1. Work in groups of 4. Match the types of forces to the picture.
Buoyant Force (upthrust force)     \       Electric Force        \   Spring Force     \       Tensional Force\
Air resistance (Drag Force)        \            Nuclear Force    \      Normal Force     \      Applied Force\
Gravitational Force       \                          Frictional Force  \     Magnetic Force  \      Balanced Force\

#### 2. Work in groups of 4. Put the types of forces into categories.
Buoyant Force (upthrust force)     \       Electric Force        \   Spring Force     \       Tensional Force\
Air resistance (Drag Force)        \            Nuclear Force    \      Normal Force     \      Applied Force\
Gravitational Force       \                          Frictional Force  \     Magnetic Force  \      Balanced Force\

Contact forces ? Non-contact forces

#### 3. Work in groups of 4. Fill the blank of types of forces for their definitions.
Buoyant Force (upthrust force)     \       Electric Force        \   Spring Force     \       Tensional Force\
Air resistance (Drag Force)        \            Nuclear Force    \      Normal Force     \      Applied Force\
Gravitational Force       \                          Frictional Force  \     Magnetic Force  \      Balanced Force\ 

_______________ is the attraction or repulsion between magnetic materials. It happens because magnets have two poles, north and south, that attract or repel each other.\
________________ is the attraction between any two objects that have mass. It’s a universal force. This means it acts between everything in the universe, from stars to apples.\
________________ is the resistance that one object encounters when moving over another. It happens because the surfaces of objects are rough, which causes them to interlock.\
________________ is the force exerted on an object by another object or person. It’s called “applied” because it needs to be actively put into action, like pushing or pulling.\
We see  ________________ through strings, ropes, and cables when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends. This force occurs because the material is stretched, trying to resist the pulling.\
________________ is the force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it. It acts perpendicular to the surface. This is why it’s called “normal” (meaning perpendicular in physics).\
________________ is the force exerted by a spring when it is compressed or stretched. It works because springs are designed to return to their original shape, creating a push or pull force in the process.\
________________ is the attraction or repulsion between particles due to their electric charges. It occurs because opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel each other.\
________________  is the force acting opposite to the relative motion of an object moving through air. It happens because as objects move, they collide with air molecules, creating resistance.\
________________  is the upward force exerted by a fluid, like water or air. It opposes the weight of an object immersed in it. It occurs because the pressure at the bottom of the object is greater than the pressure at the top, creating an upward force.\

#### 4. Work in groups of 4. Give at least one example for four of the forces.
Buoyant Force (upthrust force)     \       Electric Force        \   Spring Force     \       Tensional Force\
Air resistance (Drag Force)        \            Nuclear Force    \      Normal Force     \      Applied Force\
Gravitational Force       \                          Frictional Force  \     Magnetic Force  \      Balanced Force\
