#### Watch the video and answer the following questions.
1. Around 440 BCE, Democritus first proposed that everything in the world was made up of tiny _______ surrounded by _______ _______ and he even speculated that they vary in _______ and _______ depending on the _______ they compose. He called these particles _______.

2. Who disagreed with Democritus?\
A. Aristotle\
B. John Dalton\
C. J. J. Thompson\
D. Ernest Rutherford

3. Aristotle believed that matter was made of four elements:  _______,_______, _______ and  _______.

4. John Dalton showed that common substances always _______ _______  into the same elements in the same  _______. For example, water can break down into _______, _______ and  _______. Another example, like carbon dioxide, it can be broken down into  _______, _______ and  _______. The various combinations of atoms of different elements have a particular _______ and  _______ that could neither be  _______ nor  _______ .

5. Development of the Atom models. Please use words and drawings if necessary to explain the differences or development of each model.
(1) J. J. Thompson, the chocolate chip cookie model\
The discovery of _____\
Atoms as uniformly packed spheres of _____ matter filled with _____ charged electrons \
(2) Ernest Rutherford\
The father of the _____ _____\
while most of the particles did  _____, some  \
Atoms consisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons while most of the  _____ was  _____ in the centre which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles  _____ _____  the gaps but _____ _____ from the dense positively charged nucleus.\
(3) Niels Bohr\
Electrons orbit the nucleus at _____ _____ and _____  able to jump from one level to another but not to exist in the space between.\
(4) Other experiments\
Rather than simply being discrete particles, electrons _____ behaved like _____, not being _____ to a _____ point in space.\
(5) Werner Heiseberg\
It was impossible to determine both the _____ _____ and _____ of electrons as they moved around an atom.

6. Now, look back to 440 BCE, was Democritus correct? Why do you think so?

7. Please summarise the history timeline: person’s name, main theory, new terms etc.
