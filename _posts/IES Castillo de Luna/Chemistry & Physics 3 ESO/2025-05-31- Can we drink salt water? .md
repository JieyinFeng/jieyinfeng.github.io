#### 1. Before we start, let’s think about ….
(1) What will make us dehydrated?\
(2) What will happen if we are dehydrated?\
(3) Can you actually drink your own pee? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axVPg5EtvKs from the 5:08)\
(4) Can we drink the salt water directly? (https://youtu.be/jdOjB0j329g?si=EctlpE9y4goZNTKL)

#### 2. What would happen if we drank salt water directly?
(1) The danger in drinking saltwater lies at the __________level. To maintain their structural _________, your body’s cells match the _____________ of certain ions, like salt, within their membranes with the concentration outside of them — in your _____________ , for instance.\
(2) Seawater is about four times saltier than your blood. So when it's ingested, the fluid outside your cells becomes much saltier. To _________ the resulting _________ difference, water flows out of your cells. \
(3) Your _________ use this water to begin removing the _________ of salt — but they require much more freshwater to actually flush it all out. \
(4) Consuming enough seawater without any freshwater can lead to ________________.\
(5) The effects can be ____________ as the body's cells lose water and contract. This can cause tissues to shift and _________ and fluids to collect in critical organs.

#### 3. How can we create the water from salt water? - Aristotle’s two models of Seawater desalination
(1) One is _________ , and relies on heating seawater to yield vaporized condensed freshwater.\
(2) The other is ________________, which uses pressure to push seawater through a salt-filtering membrane — a process Aristotle documented with a sealed wax jar.

#### 4. Which one is better and why?

#### 5. WRITE AND SPEAK. If you are sailing in the ocean alone, and you need freshwater, what can you do?
How to turn the saltwater into freshwater?\
What kind of food should you avoid eating?\
Shall you drink your own urine?\
Can you get some drinkable water from somewhere else?
