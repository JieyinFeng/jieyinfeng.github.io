#### Watch the video and answer the following questions.
1. From 1952 to 1953, Sydney detectives investigated a ________ number of murder and ________  murder cases that were ________ yet shared a common element: thallium poisoning.

2. The secret to thallium toxicity lies in its structural similarity to potassium — an element that helps ________ the body's fluids ________ muscle contraction, and ________ nerve signals.

3. If even a small amount of thallium ________ its way into the body — for example, through a ________ tea or a slice of cake — it easily ________ potassium, causing the body to slowly and painfully shut down.

4. Lead, for example, ________ places with the body's essential metals like calcium, in turn ________ neuronal communication in the brain. Travelling through the bloodstream, it also ________ toxic levels of molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which over time can stress and kill cells.

5. What is “Mad Hatter” disease?

6. Mercury is quick to ________ with certain parts of proteins found throughout the body. And upon  ________, mercury ________ the proteins into different shapes, rendering them useless. 

7. Some elements are dangerous because of how they ________, ________ , or even ________ in the outside environment. 

8. Which column of the periodic table are known as alkali metals? _____________

9. This can lead to violent results— pure cesium, for example, bursts into flames when exposed to air, and explodes when dropped in water. Francium is likely the most reactive alkali based on its position
in the periodic table, but we don't know for sure. With a ________ of ________ minutes at most, it's thought that less than ________ ________ exists on Earth at any one time.

10. Which elements are perhaps the most threatening elements?  _____________

11. The substances readily ________ energy, or ________ , due to their highly unstable nuclear composition. This reactive nature is what's ________ to create some of the world's most dangerous
nuclear weapons. 

12. Radioactive elements typically emit energy in the form of ________________,  ________________,  ________________ , or  ________________. 

13. Which radioactive element is particularly hazardous?  _____________

14. In fact, it's theorised that a single gram of one alpha emitter, polonium, could kill upwards of  ________   ________ people. Polonium was first discovered by  ________  ________ , and tragically her daughter, researcher Irene Joliot-Curie, may have been one of its first victims after she was exposed in a lab accident. Polonium is rare in nature with few commercial uses, so only a small amount is synthesised each year. 

15. Thallium, on the other hand, wasn't so difficult to find in the early 1950s in Australia. At the time, Sydney was ________ with chronic rat infestations. And thallium was the main ingredient in the popular and cheap rat poison called Thall-Rat.
