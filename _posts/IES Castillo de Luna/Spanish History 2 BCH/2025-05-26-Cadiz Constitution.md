## 3. Supplementary Reading 
Other articles reformed taxes and the Treasury, created a national army with compulsory military service, and established public and compulsory primary education. The territory was divided into provinces governed by provincial councils, and town councils with elected officials were formed. The National Militia (an army of citizens to defend the constitutional system) was also created. In religious matters, the Catholic denomination of the State was affirmed.
In addition to the Constitution of 1812, the Cortes of Cadiz approved laws and decrees to eliminate the Ancien Régime and establish a liberal state. For example, jurisdictional lordships were abolished, territorial lordships were transformed into private property of the lords, entailed estates were eliminated, and communal lands were confiscated to raise funds to pay off the public debt.
The Inquisition was also abolished, freedom of the press and freedom of labor were approved, and guilds were suppressed.
Mayorazgo : medieval institution by which the assets are linked to a family or institution (town hall, religious order, etc.) and are passed in their entirety to the heir of the title. In this way, the properties could not be divided or sold, which slowed the growth and modernization of agriculture. They constituted the majority of the land, which also caused the price of the land that was for sale to rise.
This new legislative framework was very advanced, much more than the reality of the war and the situation of the country allowed, so it had little practical impact. With the war, the reforms could hardly be carried out and the return of Ferdinand VII meant the return to absolutism and the elimination of all of them.
