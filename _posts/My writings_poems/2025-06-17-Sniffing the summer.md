[en inglés]

The smell of pimiento at the corridor\
Heading out for fresh air\
The old man carrying the beach chair\
Straight up to the breeze

Soft breeze from the ocean\
Taking a cat nap\
Cold beer with the sunset\
Bathing in the sound of the waves

The waves sparkling under the sun\
Splashing away my mysterious mood\
The moon starting to set, together with the Jupiter\
Enjoying the lost of time

The time melted in the tinto de verano\
Refreshing my dizzy head\
Spanish guitar and the flamenco chanting\
Spinning around the taberna

The taberna infused with happiness\
Serving delicious tapas\
Decanting wines and tap beers\
Enjoying the vibes and the night\
An enchanting night

##### Background of the poem:
The summer started in Spain. It is June. I bought a beach umbrella. On a relaxing Sunday afternoon, I brought my towels, umbrella, and two cans of Rose beers to the beach. I enjoyed some great aftenon.\
There are two versions of this poem - English and Spanish.
