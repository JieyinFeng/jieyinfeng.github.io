Wine bottles\
with different labels on \
pretty designs\
standing up to the wall together\
hollow inside

Craft beers\
but only one option\
crystal, pale, thin\
crispy, shining, bubbling\
full tap

Sunlight\
Shining to the eyes\
Quite bright\
Leaving the shadow in the corner\
unspoken, speechless

Oh, look

The palm tree grows wildly\
Surging out of the big trees\
Very strong\
Curving up to the sky\
Towards the sunlight


##### Background of the poem:
I wrote this poem to cheer up my friend who was anxious about his business due to the policy change.
I was travelling to Seville and I saw a palm tree growing out of the other bushes. It looked very wild to me. I thought it was the same situation as my friend's.
