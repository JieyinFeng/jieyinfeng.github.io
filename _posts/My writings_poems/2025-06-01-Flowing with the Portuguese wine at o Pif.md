Locals, travellers like me, and I\
sitting in a wine bar at the end of the street

Soulful music, floating around the place\
light drum beats, splashing to my ears\
Rosé coloured wall, simmering with the vibe\
Wine candles, burning at the back\
Wine glasses, playing their own choir quietly in the corner\
Different labelled wine bottles, standing up to the wall together, shining 

Sommelier and customers, chatting in French\
A couple behind me, sitting towards each other with heartfelt eyes \
Me at the bar, sipping Douro wine with smiles
