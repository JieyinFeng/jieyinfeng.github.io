Two glasses of orange juice, sitting on the breakfast bar\
The washing machine is humming in the kitchen corner\
Pans and pots are patting each other\
An English gentleman is making coffee

The blue couch and wooden tables, modern yet comfy\
A warm breeze is circling through the apartment\
Green lights flashing from the wifi box, steadily, silently\
The English gentleman is lounging on the sofa

Sand coloured tiles and the white bathtub\
Steam fills the air\
Water dripping, bright light shining from the opaque mirror\
The English gentleman is shaving his beard

Cream curtains, cotton smell\
Winter sunlight captured the quiet bed\
Soft pillows, covered with tropical flowers\
White wardrobes and silver knobs are standing still\
The English gentleman’s laptop is resting on the desk


##### Background of the poem 背景:
Today is January 4th, 2026. This is the first poem of the new year. We are travelling in Almería from December 30th to January 5th. It is more of a holiday for both of us. He is from England, and I am from China. I consulted him for a few words to polish my poems, and he agreed to put his name as a sign-off. It is a poem about the holiday time in Almería.
