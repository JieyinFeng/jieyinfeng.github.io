<h5>研究经历 Research Experience</h5>
1. 08/2019 - 08/2021 BrainLENS-East Lab, Reading and Dyslexia, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut, USA<br />
+ Supervised by Professor Fumiko Hoeft Ph.D. M.D.<br />
+ Main Project: Neural mechanisms underlying compensation in Dyslexia, *longitudinal study (5 visits)*, with neuropsychological assessments, TMS and multimodal MRI (fMRI, DWI, MRS, Resting State) and saliva sample.<br />
(1)  Worked as the project leader of a multi-center NIH R01 grant project, including:
- Cross-center project management: work timeline, database management, hosting meetings, budgeting, coping with project materials and required paperwork
- External communication and coordination with the Georgia state team (3 principal investigators and 3 research assistants);
- Internal management with personnel arrangement, training, and communication on the East Coast team (20 people in total, 2 principal investigators, 2 postdoc staff, 3 MRI technicians, 3 research assistants, 10 undergraduate assistants);
- Worked as the primary MRI personnel and TMS helper, including MRI data collection, analysis, and management; helping TMS operation;
- Worked as the primary project contact personnel, including participant recruitment, appointment scheduling, billing and emergency contact.
(2) Finished an NIH R01 funding proposal, manuscripts writing and publication

2. 09/2016 - 06/2019 CaiLab, Language Cognition and Development, Institute of Cognitive Science, East China Normal University, China<br />
+ Supervised by Professor Qing Cai Ph.D.<br />
(1) Main Project: Neural mechanisms of pinyin and writing in L2 Chinese word reading (L2: second language), *longitudinal study (2 visits & 7-day training session)*, with neuropsychological assessments and fMRI.<br />
- Role: project leader, study design, data collection, data analysis, paper writing.<br />
- The study mainly focuses on neural mechanisms for Chinese second language learning of English natives, with different learning strategies (pinyin, writing), and tested in 3 modalities, visual, auditory, and visual-auditory. <br />
- Aims: (1) to study changes in neural mechanisms and visual retinotopic mappings between strategies; (2) using cognitive test data, to check whether we can predict second language proficiency; (3) and in bilingual reading, to compare universal and specific brain signature cross-languages.<br />
(2) Side Project: Word reading, writing and pinyin in 6-year-old children, *longitudinal study (2 visits)*, with neuropsychological assessments and multimodal MRI (fMRI, DWI and Resting State).<br />

3. 06/2014 - 06/2016 Facial Expression Recognition, School of Educational Psychology, University of Jinan, China<br />
+ Supervised by Associate Professor Sutao Song Ph.D.<br />
+ Multiple Projects: Emotional faces and scenes recognition, with ERP<br />
(1) The influence of facial feature in emotional faces recognition in NimStim.<br />
- Role: project leader, study design, data collection, data analysis, paper writing.<br />
- Our work involved the modulation of tiny features in facial expression recognition on some early components, e.g. N170, P100, VPP.<br />
(2) Gender role differences of female college students in facial expression recognition.<br />
- Role: project leader, study design, data collection, data analysis, paper writing.<br />
- We focused on the psychological factor in facial expression recognition, i.e. the gender role and its effect on N170 and VPP by the comparison between emotional states. <br />
(3) Disgust and Fear works differently on LPP, the modulation of emotional faces and scenes.<br />
- Role: project leader, study design, data collection, data analysis, paper writing.<br />
- The study was about modulations of facial expression recognition, particularly on the distinction of disgust and fear. Unlike previous projects, we mainly test the mid- and long-term ERP components, like EPN and LPP in this study. <br />
